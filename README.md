# React Pokémon App with Search Functionality

This project is a Pokémon card display application built using **React**. It allows users to fetch Pokémon data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and filter the Pokémon based on a search query using a search bar.

## Features

- **Responsive Header** with search functionality
- **Pokémon Cards** with details (image, name, height, weight, and order)
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for a specific Pokémon by its name, and the displayed cards will dynamically update based on the query.
